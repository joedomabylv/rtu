diary_in = @"Dear diary,
I used to think AJ Chickenwing
was my friend... until he made
me and TBone Joe fight to the
death. All this time... AJ was
using me. It's all part of his
evil plan. How could I not see
this before? He wants to...

RANCH THE UNIVERSE...

I've finally found AJ's prison
fortress. Tonight I'm going to
sneak into the castle, find
TBone Joe, and uncover AJ's 
true motivations.

If I don't stop him... I'm
afraid no one will.
- Turkey Tim";
